Decorator design pattern used to modify the functionality of on a object runtime. At the same time other instances of
same class will no be affected by this, so individual object get the modified behavior.


* Decorator Pattern important
    - Decorator Desing pattern is helpful in providing runtime modification abilities and hence more flexible.
        It easy to maintain and extend number of choice are more.
    - The disadvantage of decorator design pattern is that it uses a lot of similar kind of objects(decorator).
    - Decorator pattern is used to a lot of Java IO classes, such as FileReader, BufferedReader.


-- Another a not.
    The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
    Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
